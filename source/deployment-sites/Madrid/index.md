### Description of the deployment site

The fundamental concept of the Madrid DS is based on the early detection and prevention of cognitive performance decrease and also on the falling risk of elderly individuals. To achieve that, Madrid DS will provide a non – intrusive monitoring of activities of daily living (ADLs) in their living environment. The living environment includes the space that the user has an active interaction along the day such as home, public transportation, day – care centres, office, etc. This concept is only possible thanks to an IoT infrastructure that transforms the living environment in a smart living environment and a strict collaboration between service suppliers and demander in both public and private sectors. The benefits for the older adults are related to the increase of the independence in their living environments thanks to personalized and ad hoc interventions that depend on a specific combination of social interaction and daily activity.

More specifically, the Madrid DS aims 1) to prevent the decrease of the cognitive performance by personal brain training and reminders, 2) to prevent the falling by physical training and exercises and 3) to prevent the social isolation by encouraging users to establish and maintain active social interactions through mobile applications.
