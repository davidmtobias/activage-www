### Description of the deployment site

Region of Galicia (2.8 M citizens), in the northwest part of Spain, has one of the highest percentage of elderly (65 or older) in Europe and faces increasing rates of chronic disease. The Galician Regional Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialization (RIS3) sets as one of the main challenges to position the region as a benchmark in Southern Europe in providing knowledge-intensive services and products related to active ageing and a healthy lifestyle. 

The importance of Galicia’s healthcare public sector, whose expenditure (3.400 M€/year, 36.000 Healthcare professionals) makes up approximately 40% of the region’s total public budget, prompted regional authorities to foster innovation aimed at improving patient-centered care supported by ICT technology.

The proposed “services and use cases” that will be piloted:

*	Integration of social and health care services:  Construction of an integrated service platform, both available and emerging, in a single user device. This platform links the physical world (e.g. through sensors and actuators) with the virtual world of information processing. 
*	Home tele-care and Mobile tele-care (integrated). Indoor and outdoor monitoring of the activity and lifestyle of the person, and the early detection of risks (falls, if a person gets lost, and others) based on behavioural analysis, for prevention and security purposes (called Styles of Life service)
*	A digital social network with video-communication among elder people to avoid isolation and loneliness
*	A system for the monitoring of chronic or pre-chronic patients through the gathering of their bio-measures (blood pressure, weight, INR, etc). The disease or diseases that will be the object of this pilot is being analysed, probably “”
*	It is important to highlight that all the described use cases incorporate accessibility aspects with the aim of adapting the solution to the needs and circumstances of every person

The main societal objectives of this pilot are:

*	To increase the security of the older people, to allow their continuity at their own life environment and the improvement of their social relationships. 
*	To reduce the negative impact of physical and/or cognitive deterioration of people over 60 with chronic disease in order to continue doing their every-day activities.
*	To improve healthy lifestyles of people over 60
*	To reduce the growing burden of chronic, non-communicable disease
*	To improve the quality of life and health status in patients with chronic diseases.

#### Expected number of users and profile

The expected user volume for the pilot is about 700. The target end users for the pilot are older people over 60 years old who require continuous monitoring either temporarily or permanently, and could be in one or more of the following situations:

*	With chronic diseases: pathologies like Atrial fibrillation are being analysed. About 200 users will be in this situation, whom will follow a specific medical protocol.
*	At the risk of chronic disease: hypertension, obesity, diabetes.
*	With low social participation and/or problems of loneliness.
*	With difficulties in following a healthy lifestyle and/or patterns of self-care related to health
*	People with dependency needs.
