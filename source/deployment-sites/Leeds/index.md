### Description of the deployment site

Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet.

**Leeds is a World Health Organisation Age Friendly City and member of the UK Network of Age Friendly cities**

It is second largest local authority outside of London and has a welcoming view towards innovation across the system, plus a strong record of joint working with the NHS (National Health Service). It has around 120,000 people aged 65 and over, estimated to rise to 153,000 by 2030. It is estimated that around 15% or 37,000 older people can be described as lonely or socially isolated and in 2013, 31,668 people in Leeds aged 65 and above were predicted to have fallen. This is projected to rise to 35,042 by 2020. The Leeds City council aims to make Leeds, the best city to grow old in.

The 2 fundamental umbrella use case for Leeds DS are:

*	Independent living support
*	Personal health and symptoms monitoring

To realise these use cases, Leeds DS will deploy energy monitoring equipment along with home sensors (door open/close, temperature, moisture etc.) and smart multifunctional wearables (Smart watches) and provide services around fall detection, emergency triggers, remote monitoring of vital health stats and non-intrusive behaviour/anomaly detection system to help give confidence for elders sustain their lives in their homes for longer time. The DS will further demonstrate reduction in social isolation through connections via technology and early intervention. 

The DS will use existing services and technologies along with service providers to demonstrate new infrastructure created on top of these.

#### IoT Platforms involved

?

#### Expected number of users and profile 

Leeds DS aims to operate with up to 1000 end users (including caregivers, family and elders). People who will engage in project will likely be self-selecting and not representative of the whole over 65s population. This is because a lot of people are reluctant with new technology. We can target people who have an interest in, and desire to learn, technology but canâ€™t account for people who are completely unwilling.

The site will aim to recruit user groups 2 (Well), 3 (Managing well), 4(Vulnerable), 5(Mildly frail) and 6(Moderately frail). Users of existing telecare system will not be included as they might be elders who have already lost their independence. Full study and recruitment plan will be updated soon.
