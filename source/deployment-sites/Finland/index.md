### Description of the deployment site

The Finnish Deployment site will implement totally 600 testbeds of which 500 devices will be installed in the cities Helsinki, Turku, Oulu and Tampere. The remaining 100 devices will be used in pain monitoring in the Helsinki and Turku university hospitals.

The installations will be both in urban and rural areas – the main characteristics of older people and care in Finland are:

*	Long distances , thus  for elderly loneliness is a big issue
*	Growing care expenses - integrated care needed
*	High AAL implementation 
*	Governmental Social Service Structure change ongoing – more private sector actors e.g. private hospitals to be built

Generally the Finnish DS will concentrate on developing these important areas during the ACTIVAGE project:

*	Pre and post surgery: rehab and pain monitoring
*	Impact measuring: pain and rehab
    * Best practice models
*	Senior and early fallers rehabilitation
    *	interRAI results – plan for rehabilitation and impact (KPI)
*	Effective rehabilitation
    *	Cost saving and faster back to work processes (how to get best results for money invested)
*	Professional match with rehab customers 
*	Online situational view regarding customers


Thus the Finnish DS will create an IoT based ecosystem focused on **Digital Rehabilitation**, which will:

*	investigate and implement physical exercises for rehabilitation
*	implement integrated care for patients requiring long term medication plans
*	collect evidence of the selected integrated IoT tools
*	adapt to the interoperability framework
