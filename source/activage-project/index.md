## About ACTIVAGE

ACTIVAGE is a European Multi Centric Large Scale Pilot on Smart Living Environments. The main objective is to build the first European IoT ecosystem across 9 Deployment Sites (DS) in seven European countries, reusing and scaling up underlying open and proprietary IoT platforms, technologies and standards, and integrating new interfaces needed to provide interoperability across these heterogeneous platforms, that will enable the deployment and operation at large scale of Active & Healthy Ageing IoT based solutions and services, supporting and extending the independent living of older adults in their living environments, and responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities.

The project will deliver the ACTIVAGE IoT Ecosystem Suite (AIOTES), a set of Techniques, Tools and Methodologies for interoperability at different layers between heterogeneous IoT Platforms and an Open Framework for providing Semantic Interoperability of IoT Platforms for AHA, addressing trustworthiness, privacy, data protection and security. User-demand driven interoperable IoT-enabled Active & Healthy Ageing solutions will be deployed on top of the AIOTES in every DS, enhancing and scaling up existing services, for the promotion of independent living, the mitigation of frailty, and preservation of quality of life and autonomy. ACTIVAGE will assess the socio-economic impact, the benefits of IoT-based smart living environments in the quality of life and autonomy, and in the sustainability of the health and social care systems, demonstrating the seamless capacity of integration and interoperability of the IoT ecosystem, and validating new business, financial and organizational models for care delivery, ensuring the sustainability after the project end, and disseminating these results to a worldwide audience. The consortium comprises industries, research centres, SMEs, service providers, public authorities encompassing the whole value chain in every Deployment Site.



## ACTIVAGE vision

The vision of ACTIVAGE is to be the global world-wide reference for providing the evidence that standard-secure-intraoperative IoT ecosystems enable new business models and cost-effective solutions for Active and Healthy Ageing, contributing to the sustainability of the health and care systems, the competitiveness of the European industry through innovation, and the improvement of the quality of life and autonomy of older adults in the form of independent living.

ACTIVAGE vision is to ignite and catalyse the strategic decisions of:

**a)** health and social care policy makers to invest public and private money in scaling up aha services to the whole population of demanding societies.

**b)** service providers to adopt new proved cost-effective business models that reduce costs to payers and increase benefits to providers and citizen, making the global health and social care systems more sustainable while reaching broader segments of users.

**c)** senior citizen and their families to be involved in the co-creation, adoption and demand of new aha services that makes their life better, safer and autonomous.

**d)** technology industry to innovate on IoT, wearables and sensor technologies, support standards for interoperability, to ignite a global health and wellbeing market growth.

**e)** SME`s and entrepreneurs to create innovative solutions and technologies in a growing demanding market.

**f)** private and public financial and business development services to fund innovation ecosystems around ACTIVAGE deployment sites and elsewhere, fuel innovation and competitiveness.



## ACTIVAGE objectives

ACTIVAGE ultimate goal is to create the evidence and to be the reference driver of this virtuous circle of the Active and Healthy Ageing market growth that will increase the demand by payers, providers and users, and will intensify the offer of solutions by the industry, SMEs and financial services.

**O1.** To deliver the ACTIVAGE IoT Ecosystem Suite (AIOTES), a set of techniques, tools and methodologies **for interoperability at different layers between heterogeneous existing IoT Platforms** and an Open Framework for providing **Semantic Interoperability of IoT Platforms for AHA**, addressing trustworthiness, privacy, data protection and security.

**O2.** To set up a European Multi Centric Large Scale Pilot distributed across nine interconnected Deployment Sites of seven European countries constituting the whole operational and evaluation space, in order **to build local IoT ecosystems on top of legacy open or proprietary IoT platforms**, encompassing all stakeholders in the AHA value chain and highlighting seamless services connectivity support while users are moving in their living environments.

**O3.** To set a common Reference Evaluation Framework implementing the GLOCAL approach able to complement Global and LOCAL reference features and requirements. The evaluation framework will allow the assessment of interoperable IoT-enabled Active & Healthy Ageing solutions enhancing and scaling up current existing services on every Deployment Site, **for the promotion of independent living, the mitigation of frailty, preservation of quality of life and autonomy of older adults in smart living environments.** The objective is to create significant evidence and value of the benefit produced on all these aspects, **for the sustainability of the H&SCS, and for validating new business, financial and organizational models for care delivery**, both in a local/national and European scope. 

**O4.** To provide a co-creation framework that enables the **identification, measurement, understanding and prediction of the demands and needs of IoT ecosystem on AHA users**: older adults, caregivers, health and social care professionals and providers, assessing their needs, preferences and perceptions regarding user acceptance, trust, confidentiality, privacy, data protection and safety. The goal of this objective is to raise and identify some unknown key success factors related also to deployment and scaling up activities. 

**O5.** To set up and operationalize a communication and dissemination program that allows **worldwide outreach of project activities and achievements**, to make ACTIVAGE a global reference framework of evidence-based values of IoT for AHA. 


## Project Structure 

#### WP1 - Project Coordination, IPR and Ethics Management

* To keep the project schedule and to guarantee the execution of the work plan and the achievement of the project goals in time and within budget.
* To coordinate the technological, scientific and innovative orientation of the ACTIVAGE project,
* To guarantee high-quality standards at all levels,
* To ensure that the ACTIVAGE project maintains its relevance towards the objectives of the program,
* To manage IPR and Ethics issues.

#### WP2 - User Requirements

The aim of this WP is to coordinate across Deployment Sites, to share a common definition of the uses cases, user needs and scenarios in order to be able to give requirement for the AIOTES development and enable common evaluation base on shared criteria, while each DS will adapt its deployment to local needs and organizational specificity. A User Centred Design (UCD) methodology (Human Centred Design process for interactive systems (ISO 9241-210) will be used in order to places the users (elderly, patients, families, caregivers (informal and professional) and in general the whole community) at the centre of the ACTIVAGE AIOTES design, implementation and evaluation process (WP9 DS). Create a preliminary guideline for the adoption of ACTIVAGE solutions in other Pilots

#### WP3 - ACTIVAGE Secure Interoperability Layer

The current work package aims at building the backbone of the ACTIVAGE Interoperability layer that will allow interconnecting heterogeneous IoT devices, European platforms and smart living services within a common ecosystem of solutions. The ultimate goal is to provide to application developers, integrators, service providers a common framework to build interoperable smart living apps and services that can be deployed, extended and replicated at deployment sites across Europe. Security and privacy will have a dedicated attention within this work package, as they are particularly important in the smart living domain and especially for applications with healthcare orientation. The main outcomes of the Work package are:
